# Malgus

## Next Best Move, Powered by your intent and actions.

Malgus observes your digital footprints, understands your context, and reveals the optimal path forward—just as its namesake, Darth Malgus, masterfully anticipated his opponents' moves in Star Wars: The Old Republic.

This macOS application seamlessly monitors your activities to build contextual awareness, then leverages Claude AI to suggest your next best actions—all while keeping your data secure and private.

*"Peace is a lie. There is only productivity."*

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER ⚠️

**THIS APPLICATION IS INVASIVE TO THE MAX.** Malgus monitors keystrokes, screen content, mouse movements, and application usage to function.
